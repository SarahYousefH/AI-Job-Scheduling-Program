## Components

### Process Class
The `Process` class represents an individual job process, containing information such as job number, machine number, sequence number, duration, and start time. It provides methods for string representations and equality checks.

### Chromosome Class
The `Chromosome` class simulates a possible scheduling solution, holding a list of `Process` instances for each machine. It supports methods to add processes, compare chromosomes based on their evaluation (fitness), and generate a schedule based on process dependencies and machine availability.

## Algorithm Features
- **Initial Population:** Randomly generated valid solutions represented by chromosomes.
- **Fitness Calculation:** Evaluates chromosomes based on the sum of job completion times.
- **Genetic Operations:** Includes selection via Roulette Wheel, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population towards optimal solutions.
- **Termination:** Stops when no improvement is observed over a set number of generations.

## Usage
The genetic algorithm is encapsulated in classes that manage the job shop scheduling scenario. Users can instantiate the `Chromosome` class, populate it with `Process` instances, and execute the algorithm to find optimized schedules.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of genetic algorithms in complex scheduling scenarios, showing significant potential for operational efficiency improvements in manufacturing and other sectors requiring precise job scheduling.
